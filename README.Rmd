**deepredeff** is a package to predict effector protein given amino acid sequences. This tool can be used to predict effectors from three different pathogens, which are oomycete, fungi, and bacteria.  


## Installation

The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ruthkr/deepredeff")
```
## Running prediction function

This is a basic example which shows you how to predict effector sequences if you have fasta file:

```{r example}
# Specify the conda environment
reticulate::use_condaenv("tensorflow", conda = "/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/conda")

# Load the package
library(deepredeff)

# Define the fasta path from the sample data
bacteria_fasta_path <- system.file("extdata", "example", paste0("bacteria_sample", ".fasta"), package = "deepredeff")

# Predict the effector candidate using bacteria model
pred_result <- deepredeff::predict_effector(
  input = bacteria_fasta_path,
  model = "bacteria"
)

# View results
pred_result %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    name = stringr::str_replace_all(name, "\\|", "âŽ®"),
    sequence = stringr::str_sub(sequence, 1, 25)
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

After getting the result, you can plot the probability distribution of the result as follows:

```{r pred_result_plot}
ggplot2::autoplot(pred_result)
```
More examples with different input formats are available on functions documentations and vignettes, please refer to the documentation.
