`deepredeff` - from ‘deep learning prediction of effector’ is a package contains trained deep learning models for predicting effector proteins. `deepredeff` has been trained to classify effector protein using set of known experimentally validated effectors from phytopathogenic bacteria, fungi and oomycetes. 

`deepredeff` has the following key features:

1. Allows user to choose different model provided depending on the input data they have. The provided models are **bacteria**, **fungi**, **oomyecete**. In case user does not know the taxon of their data, then they can use option **all** which will use the model trained in all training datasets. 

2. Supports effector proteins prediction with different input formats, which are FASTA, data frame, AAString, AAStringset, or even string format data. 

3. Allows user to get quick summary and plot of the prediction results they have. 

This vignette provides a brief overview of the capabilities of `deepredeff` package.

## Installation

I will show you how to install the `deepredeff` package and prepare some requirements to get it ready to be used. First, we need to install the package itself by doing the following step:

### Install deepredeff

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ruthkr/deepredeff")
```

The deepredeff package uses TensorFlow which is distributed as a Python package and so needs to be installed within a Python environment on your system. Therefore, you need to have Python in your system and the TensorFlow backend. If you already have TensorFlow installed in your system, then you can specify the environment where your TensorFlow is installed using `reticulate::use_condaenv()`.

If you do not have TensorFlow, then you can install it by simply following this step below:

### Installing TensorFlow

To install TensorFlow on your system, you need to run the following commands. **Note that this only needs to be run once** (the first time you use `deepredeff`).

```r
library(deepredeff)
install_tensorflow()
```
This will provide you with an installation of Python and TensorFlow suitable for use with the `deepredeff` R package. In particular, this command will download and install Miniconda, and create the `r-reticulate` environment in the following locations:

- **GNU/Linux**: `/home/<user>/.local/share/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate`

- **macOS**: `/Users/<user>/Library/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate`

- **Windows**: `C:/Users/runneradmin/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate`

## Sample data

Sample data that will be used here is bacterial proteins provided within this package. These sample data contain ten different protein sequences in FASTA format. These data can be loaded as follows: 

```r
library(deepredeff)

# Define the fasta path from the sample data
bacteria_fasta_path <- system.file(
  "extdata/example", "bacteria_sample.fasta", 
  package = "deepredeff"
)

bacteria_fasta_path
#> [1] "/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.0.0/lib/R/library/deepredeff/extdata/example/bacteria_sample.fasta"
```

## Effector prediction

Once the data are loaded, you can predict them using the function `predict_effector()`. Since it is known that the sample data are bacterial protein, then we can use particular model trained previously using bacterial protein data by choosing `model = bacteria`. This prediction can be done as follows. 

```r
# Predict the effector candidate using bacteria model
pred_result <- deepredeff::predict_effector(
  input = bacteria_fasta_path,
  model = "bacteria"
)
#> Loaded models successfully!
#> Model used for taxon bacteria: ensemble_weighted.
```

Note here that for taxon bacteria, model used is `ensemble_weighted` which is the weighted ensemble model of four different models (CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, GRU Embedding, and LSTM Embedding). 

```r
# View prediction results
pred_result %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(name = substr(name, 1, 25), 
                sequence = substr(sequence, 1, 25))
#>                         name                  sequence    s_score   prediction
#> 1  tr|A0A0N8SZV2|A0A0N8SZV2_ MPINRPAFNLKLNTAIAQPTLKKDA 0.94834236     effector

```

Prediction results from deepredeff will give you a dataframe object contains three different columns: 

1. **`name`**: contains your sequence identifiers.
2. **`sequence`**: contains your original.
3. **`s_score`**: an output value from sigmoid function, between 0 and 1. a probability prediction of each sequence. This value indicates how likely a sequence is to be an effector. The default probability cutoff value of deepredeff is 0.5. It means a sequence with probability prediction ≥ 0.5 is an effector, otherwise it is a non-effector.
4. **`prediction`**: prediction class obtained from `s_score`. 

## Summary and plot

After getting the prediction results, you can get the overall information of the prediction results by running `summary()`. With this, you can get information on how many of your data are predicted as effectors and non-effectors. This function is very useful if you have big number of sequence data. The summary below shows the overall summaries of the prediction results using `deepredeff`. From ten sequences as input, there are four sequences predicted as effectors and six sequences predicted as non-effectors. This summary also shows what taxon you choose and the model used. 

```r
summary(pred_result)
#> Total sequences in input data: 10
#> ---
#> Taxon chosen: bacteria
#> Model type used: ensemble_weighted
#> 
#> Total sequences predicted as effector: 4
#> Total sequences predicted as non-effector: 6
```

Next, you can also plot the density distribution of the prediction results by running `plot()`  command. From the plot below, you can see the probability distribution of each class. 

```r
plot(pred_result)
```
