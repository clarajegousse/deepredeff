Description: deepredeff - from ‘deep learning prediction of effectors’ is a package 
    that contains trained deep learning models for predicting effector proteins. 
    deepredeff has been trained to identify effector proteins using a set of known 
    experimentally validated effectors from either bacteria, fungi or oomycetes.
